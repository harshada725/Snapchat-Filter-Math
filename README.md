# Snapchat-Filter-Math
Java Convolution Filter basic Image filtering.
This project demonstrates **basic image convolution** using Java. Convolution is a core concept in **image processing**, **computer vision**, and even powers modern-day **Snapchat and Instagram filters**.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Convolution?

Convolution is a mathematical operation used to apply transformations to images such as:
- **Blurring**
- **Sharpening**
- **Edge Detection**

It works by sliding a small matrix (called a **filter** or **kernel**) over the image and performing element-wise multiplication followed by summation.

## Used in Applications
-Social Media Filters (Snapchat, Instagram)
-Edge Detection in Computer Vision
-Medical Imaging
-Object Detection and Face Recognition

## Future Enhancements
-Apply convolution on real images using BufferedImage.
-Implement multiple filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection).
-Add GUI to visualize the result.
